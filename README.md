## Functionalities

- Question, Solution, and Comment Posting
- Moderation Feature - Checks for content falling in the categories "identity_attack", "insult", "obscene", "severe_toxicity", "sexual_explicit", "threat" and"toxicity"
- Text Formatting
- Search by category, question title, question description (Infinite scroll)
- Question sorting on homescreen on the basis of timestamp and number of solution posted for a particular question
- Infinite Scroll on Home Page for user feed - Pagination
- When User will post a solution a notification via email will be sent to the author of the Question

## Workflow

#### For a student

1. Register
2. Add a Question
3. Add solutions to other student's question.
4. Add a comment to any posted solution.

#### Posting a Question

1. Student need to provide the title, category(tech-stack), description to the question.
2. On sending the request the description will be checked by the tensorflow toxicity model
   - In case some toxic text are found, the question will not be posted
   - Else the question will be posted.
3. User can visit the posted question from the homescreen
4. User can format the text as per his choice. (Bold, font-size, font-family etc feature has been added using tinyMCE)

#### Posting a Solution

1. Student need to provide the description of the solution.
2. On sending the request the description will be checked by the tensorflow toxicity model
   - In case some toxic text are found, the solution will not be posted
   - Else the solution will be posted.
   - Email will be sent to the author of the question with the link to the question
     ![Email to Author of Question](https://github.com/poojagl85/Memory-Limit-Exceeded/blob/master/src/assets/Email%20Snapshot.PNG)
3. User can visit the posted solution from the homescreen
4. User can format the text as per his choice. (Bold, font-size, font-family etc feature has been added using tinyMCE)

#### Posting Comments

1. Student can add a comment to any solution.
2. On sending the request the description of the comment will be checked by the tensorflow toxicity model
   - In case some toxic text are found, the solution will not be posted
   - Else the solution will be posted.
3. User can visit the posted comments from the homescreen

### Future Goals

- Upvotes/Downvotes for a particular solution
- Enhancing the experience and accessibilty for the user
- In case of toxic content user can be penalized by either blocking or setting a duration in which he/she will not be allowed to post
